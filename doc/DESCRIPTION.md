GhostFile is a lightweight, one-time file upload server that automatically shuts down after handling an upload. Itâ€™s designed for quick, ephemeral file transfers and is distributed as a single, self-contained binary. GhostFile can run in either command-line (CLI) mode or with a graphical user interface (GUI).
